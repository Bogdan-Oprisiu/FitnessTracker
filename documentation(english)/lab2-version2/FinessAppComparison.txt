Fitness Tracker App Comparison

This project includes a comparison between the Fitness Tracker App and several popular fitness apps, such as FitTrack, MyFitnessPal, Strava, Nike Training Club, and Fitbit. 
Here is a brief summary of how our app stands out:

Workout Planner: 
    Our app offers a robust and user-friendly workout planner, making it easy to create and customize workout routines. 
    While other apps like FitTrack, Nike Training Club, and Fitbit also provide workout planners, MyFitnessPal offers only limited planning functionality, and Strava lacks a planner entirely.

AI Workout Planning: 
    Unlike most competitors, our app integrates AI to provide personalized workout plans, tailored to individual user preferences and fitness goals. 
    This unique feature is a major differentiator from other fitness apps, which do not offer any AI-driven planning.

Watch Integration: 
    Our app has full smartwatch integration, allowing users to monitor workouts seamlessly in real time. 
    Competitors like FitTrack, MyFitnessPal, Strava, and Fitbit also offer watch integration, but Nike Training Club does not support it.

Detailed Statistics: 
    Our app provides detailed and insightful statistics to help users track their progress and make informed decisions about their fitness journey.
    While FitTrack provides limited stats, and Nike Training Club and Fitbit provide only basic statistics, MyFitnessPal and Strava are also capable of delivering detailed information.
