  "workoutPlan": "## 5-Minute Beginner Chest & Back Workout\n\nThis workout focuses on chest exercises only, as there are no back exercises provided in your list.  To create a balanced workout, you'll need to add back exercises.  This plan prioritizes chest and provides a framework you can adapt once you have suitable back exercises.\n\n**Warm-up (1 minute):**\n\n* Arm circles (forward and backward, 30 seconds each)\n* Shoulder rotations (forward and backward, 30 seconds each)\n* Chest stretches (e.g., cross-body chest stretch, holding for 15 seconds each side)\n\n\n**Main Workout (3 minutes):**\n\nWe'll alternate between two chest exercises to maximize time efficiency.  Aim for 10-12 repetitions of each exercise, with minimal rest between sets.\n\n* **Incline Push-Ups (30 seconds):**  Find a stable surface at a comfortable incline (a bench or sturdy chair works well). Perform incline push-ups, focusing on controlled movement. If this is too difficult, modify by doing push-ups against a wall.\n* **Resistance Band Chest Press (30 seconds):** Anchor the resistance band securely.  Perform chest presses, focusing on squeezing your chest muscles at the end of each repetition.  Adjust the band resistance as needed.\n\n\n**Repeat the above two exercises for a total of three rounds.** (This accounts for the 3 minutes allocated)\n\n\n**Cool-down (1 minute):**\n\n* Static stretches: Hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n    * Chest stretch (cross-body reach)\n    * Triceps stretch (reaching behind your head)\n    * Shoulder stretch (arm across the body)\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Listen to your body:** If you feel any pain, stop the exercise immediately.\n* **Proper form:** Focus on maintaining correct form throughout each exercise to prevent injury and maximize effectiveness.  If unsure, watch videos demonstrating proper technique.\n* **Progression:** As you get stronger, you can increase the number of repetitions, sets, or the difficulty of the exercises.  Consider adding weight to the resistance band or progressing to standard push-ups once you feel comfortable.\n* **Adding Back Exercises:**  To make this a complete upper-body workout, you'll need to incorporate back exercises.
