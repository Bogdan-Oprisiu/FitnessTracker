Remember to listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain.\n\n**Warm-up (2 minutes):**\n\n1. **Arm circles:** Forward and backward (30 seconds each direction).\n2. **Chest stretches:** Clasp hands behind your back and gently straighten your arms, feeling a stretch in your chest. Hold for 15 seconds. Repeat twice.\n3. **Dynamic stretches:**  Incline push-ups against a wall (5 repetitions).\n\n\n**Main Workout (7 minutes):**\n\nPerform each exercise for 30 seconds, followed by a 15-second rest.
